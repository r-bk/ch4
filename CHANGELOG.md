## [Unreleased]
### Added
- support `RFC 8482` for synthetic `HINFO` response on `ANY` query.
  Till now `HINFO` record type was treated as obsolete, and its data wasn't formatted in zone output.

- `UDP` is used by default for all queries, including `ANY`

## [0.3.0] - 2021-08-27

  CNAME flattening to find the requested record type. Only record data is printed,
  one record on a line.
